# SQL-Prepared-statment-
A way to protect against SQL injection attacks is to use prepared statements with parameterized queries. 
This ensures that user input is properly sanitized and separated from the SQL command. 
Another way is to use the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) which abstract the SQL query from the developer and handle the parameter binding automatically.

To write safe and secure SQL code, it is important to always validate user input, use prepared statements with parameterized queries, and to use the least privilege principle, which means giving users the least amount of access necessary to perform their tasks. It is also important to keep your database and software up to date with the latest security patches.

Also, it's important to use the best practice of not storing sensitive information like passwords or credit card numbers in plain text in the database.
